What It Is
---
This is an NextJS application that allows clients to submit support ticket request. In this request they will be able to include a name, email and description of the problem they are experiencing.
An Admin user is able to drill down into the ticket, respond and update the status of the ticket.

What I Used
---
* NextJS  
* Prisma
* Vercel
* Postgres

Challenges and Solutions
---

* Challenge #1: Learning a new framework:
  * This project was the first use of NextJS, Prisma, and Vercel. Took some research to understand and utilize the framework and tools.
* Challenge #2: Limiting scope
  There are many features you want to add in given an open-ended request. In order to create an MVP I had to prioritize features to make sure something may be shipped within the time frame

  
Wish to include
--
* User creation page and Login page
  * Allow users to log in as a client or admin
* Add a global state management library like redux to reduce prop drilling
* Track admins response to ticket and which admin worked on which ticket
